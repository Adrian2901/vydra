## Things that increase the quality of a bug report
    - The presence of most useful elements (over 20% importance according to study done by Bettenburg et al.)
        - steps to reproduce (83%)
        - stack traces (57%)
        - test cases (51%)
        - observed behavior (33%)
        - screenshots (26%)
        - expected behavior (22%)

## Things that decrease the quality of a bug report
    - Missing information
    - Duplicate bug report
    - Bad grammar
    - Unstructured and too verbose text
    - Complicated/hard to follow steps to reproduce

## Things to keep in mind
    - Different knowledge levels between bug reporters
    - Rude/sarcastic bug reports are less likely to be solved
