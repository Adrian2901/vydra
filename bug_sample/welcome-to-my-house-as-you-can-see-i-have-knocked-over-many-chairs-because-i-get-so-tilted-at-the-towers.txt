Welcome to my house. As you can see I have knocked over many chairs because I get so tilted at the towers.

Well this isn't really titled or a tower.

Well you see, it's a gamer pad. not many girls come in here because i get friend zoned so frequently, but that's ok.

I'd like to be in the friend zone! I like friends!

It's not as pleasant as you think. They don't treat you like a friend, they treat you like an item. Sometimes I wish I could be more than just an accessory to these women. But unfortunately, as a gamer I dont get respect.

Well i'm not a gamer, so maybe they will respect me!

That just makes you a beta cuck. That's the difference between you and I, Silver the hedgehog, I'm an alpha gamer!
